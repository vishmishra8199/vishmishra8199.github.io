        Hey Guys!!,
      </p>
      <p>
        I am 21 years old, just entered into the world of real geeks by taking admission in <a id="link1" href="https://www.iiit.ac.in/">IIIT Hyderabad</a>.
        I know it's worth it after 2 years that's why I am working enough I can to get my things done.
        
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend my childhood in different cities because of my father's transferable job. Did my schooling in almost 6-7 schools.
        Till 10th I studied in CBSE board and did my high school in Maharashtra state board.  
      </p>
      
      <p>
        After that I joined JEC Jabalpur for my B.tech in Computer Science and Engineering. In that 4 years I learned a lot
        which helped to shape my personality as well as different skills. I completed my graduation this year with 7.98 CGPA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most of the batchmate in my b.tech, I also started preparing for my gate in my last year. I worked hard and 
        was abled to secure 965 rank in Gate 2021. Which also gave me confidence to apply for PGEE for M.Tech in IIIT Hyderabad.

      </p>
      <p>
        And now I am in this college and learning each day with enthusiation and trying to increase my knowledge set and skills set.
      </p>
      <p>
        M.tech at IIIT Hyderabad in comuter science is my current profile and having fun with doing these assignments.
        </p>
      <p>
        My future plan is to get a decent job in my field and gain experience on different technologies whichever interests me.
      </p>

      <p>
        And using all those experiences I have to build myself in a way such that I'll be capable to achieve what I can.
